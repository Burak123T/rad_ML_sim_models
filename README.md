<h1>RAD Machine Learning Simulation Models</h1>
<b>Creating pipelines to simulate data-intensive tasks for RAD: https://github.com/Burak123T/radiation-testing-framework/.</b>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
The purpose of this repository is to develop machine learning models and tools to benchmark edge devices under radiation. 
We will create Machine Learning Pipelines (ML Pipelines) which will act as simulation software for data-intesive tasks. 
The idea is that, while these ML Pipelines are running, the <b>Radiation Testing Framework</b> will run in the background to catch and benchmark any sign of computer errors. 
With this, developers should be able to benchmark their COTS devices while, say, they are being tested for radiation hardening. 

Specifically, we are targetting the Nvidia Jetson AGX Orin (read more here: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/).
